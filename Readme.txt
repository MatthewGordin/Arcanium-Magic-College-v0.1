This is a demo of a 2D game called Arcanium: Magic College.
It is a turned-based Role-Playing Game (RPG) where you, the 
Hero, obtain the gift of magic and set off on an adventure to 
learn more about the secrets of your new magical powers. In 
this demo, you can play through the prologue, where you can 
fight monsters and explore the forest surrounding the Hero's 
hometown.

Accessibility:

Arcanium: Magic College was designed with a focus on 
accessibility, particularly for the blind and visually
impaired, and the deaf and hearing impaired. Arcanium supports
primarily the NVDA screen reader by NV Access, which is 
available at https://nvaccess.org. All necessary information 
to play the game is portrayed both visually and audibly (with
the use of a screen reader).

Arcanium: Magic College was created as part of a Senior 
Design project by Albert Antero, Jania Carla Cunanan, Ryan 
Desacola, Ean Engdahl, Matthew Gordin, Maria Lisondra, Tyler 
Proffitt, Christian Saracay, and Lisel Anne Valdez. Source 
code is under the BSD software license and provides examples 
for how to use behaviors, load from JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON), physics, and the use of focus for accessibility.
